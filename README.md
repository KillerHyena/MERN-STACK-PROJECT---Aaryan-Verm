### ‚úÖ MERN Stack To-Do List Web App

This project is a fully functional **To-Do List application** developed using the **MERN stack** ‚Äì **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. It allows users to seamlessly create, read, update, and delete tasks with real-time UI updates and a mobile-responsive interface. The frontend and backend are deployed separately, ensuring production readiness and scalable architecture.

The application supports all standard CRUD operations. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, edit them on the fly, or delete them. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js and connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The frontend is built with React.js, styled with CSS, and communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs. The UI updates in real-time to ensure a smooth user experience.

For deployment, the **frontend** is hosted on **Netlify**, and the **backend** is deployed on **Render**. Environment variables are used securely to configure API endpoints and database connections. Postman was used for testing APIs during development, and version control was managed using Git and GitHub.

#### üîß Tech Stack:

* **Frontend**: React.js, CSS
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
* **API Testing**: Postman
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
* **Deployment**: Netlify (Frontend), Render (Backend)

#### üìÅ Project Structure:

The project is divided into two main directories:

* `/client` ‚Äì Contains the React frontend with components like `TodoForm`, `TodoList`, and `TodoItem`.
* `/server` ‚Äì Contains backend logic including database models (`Todo.js`), API routes (`todos.js`), and MongoDB connection configuration.

#### üìå Key Features:

* Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks
* Real-time UI updates
* Responsive design for all devices
* Environment-variable-based configuration
* Clean folder structure for easy maintenance

#### üôå Purpose & Learning:

This project was built as part of the **Devtown Full Stack Bootcamp**. It helped solidify my understanding of full-stack development, API integration, environment configuration, and real-world deployment. The hands-on experience improved my ability to build scalable apps and enhanced my problem-solving skills as a MERN developer.
